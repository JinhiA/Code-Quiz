## Installation 

* To begin, I created a seperate HTML, CSS, and Javascript file for the "home page", "game page", and "ending results page".
* Questions were created in an array so that I would be able to store the questions along with answers and be able to create a funtion to check the user selections.

* Next when the user clicks start to begin the quiz, a timer begins and the user will be able to see if their choice is correct or incorrect as the choice button will show in green for correct and red for incorrect.  

* At the end of the quiz, the user will see their score and they will be able to save their name and score. 

* User will be able to play again or go back to the "home page" to see the log of high scores.
